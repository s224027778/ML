# ML
This program demonstartes a Simple Linear Regression Program that predicts house prices based on size. The first four lines of code import the libraries/packages needed. matplotlib.pyplot is used for plotting graphs and Linearregression is used to create and train a linear regression model. Next we define our sample data(lines 6 & 7) as a numpy array where X contains our feature values in this case our house sizes and Y contains target values which are the house prices. In line 9 and 10 we create and train the model. An instance of LinearRegression is created and assigned to the variable model. The fit method is used to train the model using the feature values X and the target values Y. Line 12 makes the predictions and the following lines of code plot and label the graph.

Steps to follow:
Open VS Code and clone the git repository, then choose a folder to clone to. Next you create a virtual enviroment to run the program. Make sure all the required extensions are installed. Install the different libraries or packages and thengenerate a requirements.txt file. Run your progarn and you are done.
